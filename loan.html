      attending an eligible U.S. college or university.
    </p>
    <p>

      is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. However, there are loans
      available at select schools that

    <p>
      Students who are attending an eligible Canadian college or university may
      use the loan comparison tool on this page to find an international student
      loan in Canada. Who is eligible to apply for study abroad loans? Students
      who are US citizens or permanent residents are eligible to apply for study
      abroad loans if they are participating in a study abroad program through
      an approved school in the United States. The student must receive credit
      at their home college or university. If you are not sure if your school is
      eligible, use our loan widget to see if your school is on the list. Your
      school must be accredited by an agency recognized by the United States
      Secretary of Education and be eligible to participate in federal student
      aid programs.

    </p>
    <p>What loans are available?</p>
    <p>
      We have designed the first ever comparison tool for loans for
      international students that will match you with lenders based on your
      needs. Simply complete a quick application and we will match you with all
      of the available lenders. To see which loans work for you, check out our
      private student loan comparison tool. With these loan options, students
      can borrow up to the full cost of their education, minus other aid
      received. Our loans help students save money, build good credit, and pay
      off their student loan faster.
    </p>
    <p>What can international student loans be used for?</p>
    <p>
      International student loans, like all private education loans, can be used
      for education-related expenses including such things as tuition, books,
      fees, insurance, transportation, room and board and other school-related
      expenses.
    </p>
    <p>What is the maximum loan amount that I can apply for?</p>
    <p>
      You can apply for up to the total cost of attendance, minus other aid, as
      determined by your school. To determine your maximum loan amount, or what
      can be included in your loan, you will need to contact your school's
      financial aid office. After you apply and receive credit approval your
      school must certify the amount of the loan. remember that the more you
      borrow the higher your student loan payments will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a non-US citizen nor a US-permanent resident studying in a destination
      outside the US, am I eligible for a loan? Unfortunately, our loan programs
      are for international students from anywhere in the world studying in the
      United States or Canada, or for US students studying abroad. We do not
      currently have student loans for international students studying elsewhere
      in the world, even with a US co-signer. What if no lenders appear on my
      comparison tool? Unfortunately if there are no lenders that appear after
      you do the comparison tool, then we do not have a loan program for the
      school. Our best advice is to contact your school, as they should know if
      there are any private student loan programs available to their
      international students. When I take out a student loan, how much do I pay
      back and when? Our comparison tool will show results for private student
      loans - not federal loans. Therefore, the interest rate and repayment will
      depend on the loan option and lender you select. When selecting a lender
      you will need to review the terms and conditions or contact the lender
      directly with your questions. If you go with a lender that requires a
      cosigner the approval and resulting interest rate will likely be
      influenced by your cosigner's creditworthiness. Every lender's range
      varies so it is important to do the loan comparison and review the
      interest rate and repayment terms. If a lender does not require a cosigner
      the interest and repayment rates are established in a different way - they
      may be determined based on the borrower's future potential, international
      credit scores, chosen field of study and many more. While some may not
      require a U.S. credit score, they do need to review a credit report from
      your home country to verify payment history and good standing. Or, how can
      I find a cosigner?
    </p>
    <p>
      A cosigner is required for many international student loan programs, but
      not all. If a cosigner is required they must be a US citizen or US
      permanent resident, with good credit, who has lived in the US for the past
      two years. Non-US citizens or non-US permanent residents cannot act as a
      cosigner. Although we are not able to assist with finding a cosigner, it
      is common to ask close friends or family members. If you do not have a
      cosigner you will want to explore lenders with loans without a cosigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can I apply for an international student loan before being accepted to my
      school? While you can begin the loan application prior to being accepted
      to your school, you will need to be accepted with your student visa to
      finalize the loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if I need to show proof of funds before I obtain a visa? Can I show
      this loan as satisfying this requirement?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some students are able to use loan approval as proof of funds, but it's
      not easy and it's up to the school and consular officer if they'll accept
      a loan approval as proper funds. You would need to apply for the loan now,
      list the school you plan to attend, get initially approved based on the
      credit of your cosigner (if you have one), then use that initial approval
      to complete your acceptance to the school.
    </p>
    <p>I need proof of funds before I can enroll, can I use loans?</p>
    <p>
      Typically you need to be admitted and enrolled, and have your visa, in
      order to apply. Some students are able to use loan approval as proof of
      funds, but its not easy and its up to the school and consular officer if
      they'll accept a loan approval as proper funds. You would need to apply
      for the loan, list the school you plan to attend, get initially approved,
      then use that initial approval to complete your acceptance to the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also have to provide a valid student visa in order to finalize
      the loan. After you apply and receive credit approval for you (and your
      cosigner), your school must certify the amount of the loan. The proceeds
      are then disbursed directly to the school.
    </p>
    <p>My school is not on the list, can I still get a loan?</p>

    <p>Are there application deadlines?</p>
    <p>No. You may apply for an International Student Loan at any time.</p>
    <p>
      If I obtained a loan last year, can I get another loan again this year?
      Yes. You can reapply each academic term for a loan.
    </p>
    <p>What is an International Student Loan?</p>
    <p>
      Federal student loans are popular with US students in the USA, but they
      are not available to international students. International Student Loans
      are specialized private education loans that are available for
      international students who are studying in the USA. International students
      may have to apply with a qualified cosigner and should only apply for
      international student loans after exhausting all scholarships, personal
      funds and other options.
